# Smart-Card-Based-Auto-Bus-Ticketing-System
##Overview
This project is designed to automate the bus ticketing process using smart card technology. It aims to provide a seamless, cashless, and efficient fare collection system for public transportation.

##Features :
Smart Card Integration: Contactless smart cards are used to store passenger data and balance for fare payments.
Automated Fare Collection: Card readers installed on buses automatically deduct the fare when passengers tap their smart card.
Centralized Data Management: A central server manages all transaction data, card balances, and route information in real-time. 
Flexible Recharge Options: Passengers can recharge their smart cards at physical recharge stations or through online platforms.
Improved Operational Efficiency: Speeds up the boarding process, reduces the need for cash handling, and minimizes errors, enhancing overall transit efficiency.

##System Components :
Smart Cards: Used by passengers to store fare balance and transaction history. Card Readers: Devices installed on buses to read smart cards and deduct fare. Central Server: Maintains and updates transaction data, card balances, and route information. Recharge Stations: Physical and online points where passengers can recharge their smart cards.

##Workflow :
Passenger Boarding: Tap the smart card on the card reader when boarding the bus. Fare Deduction: The system calculates and deducts the fare based on the route. Data Update: Transaction details and card balance are updated in real-time on the central server. Recharge: Passengers can add balance to their cards at recharge stations or online.
